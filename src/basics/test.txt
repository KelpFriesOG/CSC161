Holy mother of files!
This is file-tackular!
I hope all the files get replaced.
I am using the replaceAll() method to replace each instance
of the word "file" in this file. I hope it works according to plan!

Oh files, how I love thee,
they are my joy and utter glee.
They last oh so long, but change fleetingly
Files, I cry for thee.
